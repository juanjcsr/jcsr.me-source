# Who am I?

I am a Software Engineer focused on using Computer Science to find new ways of helping people solve problems. Lately I have been building apps that deal with large volumes of data to help Data Scientists do a better job.


As a “fullstack” developer, I am comfortable building both frontend and backend tools. Currently, I am excited about Distributed Systems and how they can help us build better software through the whole stack.
